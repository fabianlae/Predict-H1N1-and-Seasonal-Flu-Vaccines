# Predict-H1N1-and-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccines
Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for h1n1_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine.  Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
