Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.

For this competition, there are two target variables:

    h1n1_vaccine - Whether respondent received H1N1 flu vaccine.
    seasonal_vaccine - Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine.

Both are binary variables: 0 = No; 1 = Yes. Some respondents didn't get either vaccine, others got only one, and some got both. This is formulated as a multilabel (and not multiclass) problem.
